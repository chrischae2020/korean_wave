lr_line.png

This is a linear regression plot where the points are the data points and the line is the linear regression line created by the model.
We picked this model to show the correlation between 'proportion english' and 'views' in a clear visualization. 
There isn't a better way to show a linear regression line without a line plot, but it would be possible to show correlaton using clustering.
The only challenge in creating the visualization was overlaying the line on the scatter point, but matplotlib was good for this graph.
This graph is good enough without context because of the title and the x/y axes labels and it is clear there is a linear regression line plotted.
